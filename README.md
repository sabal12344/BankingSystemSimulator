# BankingSystemSimulator
a console based banking system simulator written in java, (i am new to java and this is my first project)
 Here i have used Random class (to generate random numbers for assigning passcode and id) and LocalDate class (to check if the registrants are of legal age).
 I will possibly make a upgrade that makes the data of users permanent.(by using file system)
