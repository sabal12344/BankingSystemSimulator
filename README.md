# BankingSystemSimulator
a console based banking system simulator written in java, (i am new to java and this is my first project)


Features : 


1. Displays a menu with 3 options (register, sign in and exit)
   

2. Registers a new user and assigns that user a unique passcode and bank id if the user chooses to register.
   

3. Asks for the assigned id , phone number(entered by user during registration),  and passcode, then provides withdrawal and deposition features if the signed in info is accurate


4. Additionally, the year of birth is taken to calculate the eligibility of the registrant.


   



 Here i have used Random class (to generate random numbers for assigning passcode and id) and LocalDate class (to check if the registrants are of legal age).

 
 I will possibly make a upgrade that makes the data of users permanent.(by using file system)
